# These are my solutions to project euler.
## Im trying to keep the solutions for the problems as simple as possible, while keeping the code effecient and accurate.
This repository will only contain the first 100 solutions, currently im only going to be using C++, but ill probably go throught again using a different coding language.
The languages ill use after compleating the first 100 Project Euler problems with C++ will be Java, Python and Haskell.
